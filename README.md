# Tkinter-firstproject


Let's understand the above lines of code −

Firstly we import all the modules we need, we have imported ttk and * (all) from tkinter library.

To create the main window of our application, we use Tk class.

window.title(), give the title to our Window app.

window.geometry(), set the size of the window and window.configure(), set its background color.

ttk.Button() makes a button.

ttk.Button(window, text="Hello, Tkinter").grid() – window means Tk so it shows in the window we created, text- will display the text in the window and grid will make it in a grid.

Window.mainloop(), this function calls the endless loop of the window, so will remain open till the user closes it.
